In the notebook I specify to clone this repository -- unfortunately, because some of the model's files are missing here because the model is too heavy for github, you will be unable to download the already trained models (vibes-concept-output and vibes-misted-concept-output). You will have to train the models yourself locally. 

Apart from that, the rest of the auxillary files for the notebook and the notebook itself are available.

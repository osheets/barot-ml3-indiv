In the notebook I specify to clone this repository for the final version of the models. Due to storage limitations, I was only able to upload the `vibes-concept-output` model completely. `vibes-misted-concept-output` lacks its trained unet and vae models. 

Apart from that, the rest of the auxillary files for the notebook and the notebook itself are available.
